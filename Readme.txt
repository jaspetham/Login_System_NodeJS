I will be attempting to create a login system with Node.JS, jade and MongoDB as database.

The port for this login system is http://localhost:3000/

Progress
1. use mongoDB
2. set up mongoDB
4. use git bash express install node modules
5. Used Passport for verification and express validator
6. use bootstrap in public nodeauth file layout
7. create user schema for mongodb
8. encrpyt password by using bcryptjs
9. finally using passport authentication for login
10. when first go in the website, does not show welcome page instead redirect to the login page
11. logout button, welcome user name.

Problem face
1. Bootstrap.css not loading?? need to redo from scratch
2. console.log is not working thats mean user register name/password is not working??
3. bcrypt cause npm start error in module. need to reinstall bcrypt 
4. how to display user name when logged in?
5. logout button doesnt work at all.
